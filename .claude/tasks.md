# Ruby WASM Sound Visualizer - Project Tasks

Project task list for tracking progress.

## Notes

- All tasks implemented with t-wada style TDD (800 tests, 100% pass)
- Ruby-first implementation: all logic in Ruby, minimal JS for browser API glue
- Chrome MCP browser testing deferred to local sessions
- Global variables eliminated: VisualizerApp container class replaces 15 `$` globals


## PicoRuby LED Visualizer Tasks (ATOM Matrix)

- [P-8] PENDING: Visual parameter tuning based on hardware feedback
  - `COMPLEMENT_MAX=45` (complement max brightness) — adjust if too dim/bright
  - `COMPLEMENT_MIN=5` (silence floor) — adjust if invisible or too strong
  - If complement looks washed out, try reducing SATURATION for complement rows
- [P-9] PENDING: Consider adding ambient complement animation (optional/future)
  - Currently complement brightness is static in silence (fixed at COMPLEMENT_MIN)
  - Could add slow sine-wave pulse for ambient glow when no audio detected

- [P-12] PENDING [Web/Local]: Button behavior tuning (optional/future)
  - Current: fixed 440Hz per press
  - Alternatives: toggle mute, level-derived frequency, hold-to-sustain
